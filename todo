- for pathogen, for vim-fugitive, you should run a command on terminal after copying the plugin files. That command is now added as a comment in vim-plugins file, but we should automate it.

- scriptify pathogen installation and cloning of vim repositories, and add delay in install-aliases script
- if pathogen is present, don't install. Same with all the plugins

If i have a dir 'notes' and i have a file notes.txt, and i try to do 'cd note', it doesn't automatically takes me to 'notes' directory coz it sees a conflict.

* If 'pwd' is inside '/Users/apple/Dropbox/codes/notes', then change the '/Users/apple/Dropbox/codes/notes' part to '~/notes`

* files/directories in dotfiles directory should not start with a dot, but when putting those files at appropriate locations via install-aliases.sh, put a dot in front.

* Instead of escape + hash for commenting out current text, or using c-], #,
  provide alternative for c-], 3 (lowercase of hash)
* Abstract out pattern-matching code to a function
* make my new 'cd' work for files which has spaces in their names
